# Stock Timing Radar — GitHub Pages Edition

This repo is ready for GitHub Pages + GitHub Actions.

## What this version does

- Runs Python inside GitHub Actions on a schedule.
- Reads tickers from `watchlist.txt`.
- Calculates EMA 5/20/89/200, RSI(14), MACD(12,26,9), volume, 52-week high/low.
- Writes static JSON to `site/data/scanner.json`.
- Deploys `site/` to GitHub Pages.

## Edit your watchlist

Open `watchlist.txt` and put one ticker per line:

```txt
NVDA
PLTR
TSLA
TSM
COST
MSFT
AMZN
ORCL
HOOD
MSTR
```

Use Yahoo-style tickers, for example:

```txt
PTT.BK
AOT.BK
0700.HK
9988.HK
```

## GitHub setup

1. Upload this whole folder to your GitHub repository.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
4. Go to **Actions**.
5. Run **Update stock data and deploy GitHub Pages**.
6. Wait until it finishes, then open the Pages URL.

## Local run, optional

You can still run the Python local app:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open:

```txt
http://localhost:8787
```

## Important note

GitHub Pages is static. The webpage can only scan tickers already generated into `site/data/scanner.json` by GitHub Actions. To add a new ticker online, edit `watchlist.txt` and run the workflow again.

## v8: Technical / Fundamental tabs

This version adds a Fundamental tab next to the Technical scanner.

Fundamental data is best-effort and generated during the GitHub Actions workflow. It is not real-time and it does not use an AI API key. If free Yahoo fields are missing, values are shown as `N/A` rather than fabricated.

Fundamental tab includes:
- Fundamental Score / Signal
- Latest Quarter / Earnings Date / Days to Next Quarter
- Revenue / Estimated Revenue / Surprise %
- QoQ and YoY placeholders when unavailable
- EPS / Estimated EPS
- Analyst target mean and upside to target
- Rules-based Fundamental Highlight in the detail section

To refresh after editing `watchlist.txt`:
1. Commit changes
2. Go to Actions
3. Run `Update stock data and deploy GitHub Pages`
4. Wait for a green check

## v8.1 Fundamental hotfix
This build adds a no-key fallback for the Fundamental tab:
- Yahoo quote v7 fallback for target/EPS/earnings date fields
- SEC companyfacts fallback for US quarterly revenue/net income/EPS plus QoQ/YoY
